# Robust Data Pipeline Infrastructure for Advanced Analytics

## Introduction
In today's data-driven environment, the capacity to quickly gather, organise, and analyse data is critical for making sound decisions. This project provides a complete data pipeline that seamlessly incorporates diverse technologies for handling environmental data. Using open-source technology, the system is designed to be scalable, dependable, and user-friendly for data intake, storage, processing, and analysis. The final system supports massive datasets and offers sophisticated analytical capabilities via interactive dashboards and visualisations.

## Project Overview
This project creates a sophisticated system for collecting, processing, and analysing environmental data using open-source tools. It ensures the system can handle large volumes of data while remaining dependable and user-friendly.

---

## High-Level Architecture
The system comprises several critical components:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - **Apache Airflow**: Schedules and organises data collection from various sources into MinIO.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for raw and processed data.
   - **Apache Iceberg**: Manages structured data, enabling schema evolution, versioning, and efficient queries.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - **Apache Spark**: Processes and transforms large datasets from Iceberg tables.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Power BI**: Creates interactive dashboards and visualisations for analysis.

## Workflow Description

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Apache Airflow retrieves data using DAGs and handles multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML).
   - Data is stored in MinIO in organised directories.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - MinIO stores raw and processed data.
   - Apache Iceberg manages structured data, enabling schema evolution and time travel queries.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Apache Spark processes and transforms large datasets from Iceberg tables.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Dremio provides a fast SQL interface for querying Iceberg tables.
   - Power BI connects to data sources for dashboards and visualisations.
